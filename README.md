# OdinProjects

Hello,

I am starting a learning journey with Odin, 
doing all HTML and CSS mini projects so that I can start
with JS, so that I am able to get a job in tech,
more specifically, as a developer.

If you see any errors in my code, or you know a simpler,
more clever solution to it, please let me know.
